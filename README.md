This project shows how to automate cybersecurity tasks using python. In the real world, using programming
to better help us in our work is a very crucial factor. In this case python can do tasks that
help cybersecurity professionals extract and access data through programming. This can be faster than what
a human can do, and also more reliable. Furthermore coding can be used multiple times to help in repetitive tasks.

Here many python concepts are applied such as opening and closing files with certain access, and changing 
the contents in the file with different statements and methods. Furthermore, there are also other projects 
that are defined in useful functions to help automate tasks. These functions use many concepts such as
loops, conditionals, string, lists and more to help the process of automating the task.
