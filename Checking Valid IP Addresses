#Use a with statement to read the file as give it a name ipAddresses.

#Use .split() function to convert it into a list

ipAddresses = ipAddresses.split()

#Now use a variable i to iterate through through the premade remove_list
#check if that variable is also in the ipAddresses List that we creates
#If it is, then remove that element from the ipAddresses List

#Once the new list is created, use the join() function to make it into a string

#Finally use the with statement again to overwrite all contents of the allowListFile
#This will ensure that only valid IP addresses will have access to the records
